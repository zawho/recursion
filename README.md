1/4/24 - In this project I will implement what I have learned from the recursion lesson of The Odin Project's Javascript track to solve two problems. In the first problem, a warm up, I will write both a non-recursive and recursive function for solving the Fibonacci sequence. In the second problem, I will write a merge sort function.
1/12/24 - Finished the Fibonacci and merge sort functions.
